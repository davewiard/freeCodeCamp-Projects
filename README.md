# freeCodeCamp

This repo is used for hosting screenshots of my freeCodeCamp front-end projects
that I have completed and any Back End files or projects I create as I move
through that certificate thread. GitHub was the only hosting service I could
find that would not randomly make the image URLs change or inaccessible.

My projects are all hosted at <https://codepen.io/davewiard/>.
